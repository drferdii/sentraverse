---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required Version | Check |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Node.js | **22.x LTS minimum** | `node --version` |
| npm | 10.x (bundled with Node 22) | `npm --version` |
| Git | 2.40+ | `git --version` |

> **Node.js version is enforced.** The bootstrap script (`scripts/setup.sh`) exits with an error if the major version is below 22. This matches the Railway production environment.

If you need to manage multiple Node versions, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
```bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

---

## Installation

### Option A — Bootstrap script (recommended)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sentra-main
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The script checks your Node version, runs `npm ci` (clean install from lockfile), and prints next steps.

### Option B — Manual

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sentra-main
npm ci
```

---

## Environment Variables

**No environment variables are required to run the development server.**

This is a fully static site — no database, no external API calls, no authentication. The `.env.example` file is provided as a placeholder for future integrations.

---

## Running the Development Server

```bash
# Webpack mode — stable, recommended for daily development
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Turbopack mode — faster HMR, experimental
npm run dev:turbo
```

The app will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### What to expect on first load
- `SentraSim` starts in idle state — click the start button to run the simulation
- `Hero` animated Audrey chat runs automatically through 4 clinical phases
- `Clients` logo marquee runs at 60s loop
- `ClinicalTrajectory` renders with demo patient data on scroll-into-view

---

## Building for Production

```bash
# 1. Type-check + build
npm run build

# 2. Run production server locally
npm run start
```

The production build runs a full TypeScript check before generating the Next.js bundle. Zero type errors are required — the build will fail otherwise.

### Verify security headers locally
After `npm run start`, use curl to confirm headers are present:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000 | grep -E "x-frame|x-content|strict-transport|content-security"
```

## Available Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Development | `npm run dev` | Dev server on :3000 (webpack, stable) |
| Dev (fast) | `npm run dev:turbo` | Dev server on :3000 (Turbopack, experimental) |
| Build | `npm run build` | TypeScript check + production bundle |
| Start | `npm run start` | Run production build locally |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | ESLint across all source files |
| Bootstrap | `bash scripts/setup.sh` | First-time setup with Node version check |
